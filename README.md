# PatternPaint
Draw using generative patterns - Android

Project from last summer, some features include: 

- Draw using a Tree Pattern, 'Seeker', Particle, and Diffusion-Limited-Aggregation
- Lots of options for each pattern
- Save the drawing as a PNG or JPEG
- Option to flatten the drawing canvas down for performance

Looking to migrate away from using the surface view and drawing thread and implementing the same features with libgdx.
